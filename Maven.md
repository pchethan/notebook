## Pre-Read

Knowning how JARs and WARs can be built manually gives perspective of what maven or any build automation tool does.

## How to build a JAR

#### JAR Structure

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html

Create jar from command-line.

```
 jar -cmf myfile.mf myjar.jar First.class
 -c creates new archive file
 -m includes manifest information from the given mf file.
 -f specifies the archive file name
```

## How to build a WAR?

#### War Structure

https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/packaging003.htm

#### Create war from command line

`jar -cvf projectname.war *`

## What is Maven?

From wikipaedia:

>Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby,
>Scala, and other languages. The Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation, where it was formerly part of the Jakarta
>Project. ”

From [1]

>Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven
>can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information. ”
(Software project here means code project)

To highlight, it can be used to manage project’s

1. Build
2. Reporting
3. Documentation

Focus is more on build aspect of mvn here.

### Form Factor

mvn is a java program. It has no UI. However, it is integrated well into Intellij and other IDEs.

## Objectives

> Maven’s primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In
> order to attain this goal, Maven deals with several areas of concern: ”
```

### 1. Providing a uniform build system

From [2]

> Maven builds a project using its project object model (POM) and a set of plugins. Once you familiarize yourself with one Maven project, you
> know how all Maven projects build. This saves time when navigating many projects. ”

### 2. Providing quality project information

> Dependencies used by the project
> Unit test reports including coverage

See [2]

### 3. Providing guidelines for best practices development

- Keeping test source code in a separate, but parallel source tree
- Using test case naming conventions to locate and execute tests
- Having test cases setup their environment instead of customizing the build for test preparation

See [2]

## Other things to note

- Was built to manage Java projects but can manage other language projects
- Extensible - Plugin based

## Execution Model

On invocation, Maven executes various operations on source/test files by recursively traversing a project folder, just like any other build automation
system. E.g., Make System

However, it has a distinct execution blueprint - a hierarchical structure of operations comprising a LifeCycle which is at root, Phases which are
constituent parts of lifecycle and Goals at the bottom of the tree.

On invocation, the maven tool (mvn) tranverses this operation tree. Each of the operation is applied within a project folder scope. So this would involve
each operation recursively traversing the project folder.

### LifeCycle, Phases & Goals

Maven defines 3 lifecycles - default, clean and site. default is the most used.

A Goal is the smallest unit of work (e.g., compile). A Phase is made up of a sequence of 0 or more goals. mvn executese goals in same sequence. A
sequence of phases make a lifecycle. mvn executes the phases in same sequence.

Goal implementations reside in plugins. A plugin may embody goals associated with different phases.

#### Hierarchical Structure



`default` lifecycle has fixed 23 phases. clean has fixed 3 phases and site has fixed 3 phases.

### Execution Sequence

mvn command line structure is mvn <options> <phase/goal> <phase/goal> <phase/goal> ...

mvn executes them in same order.

```
If phase is specified, mvn executes all preceding phases before running the specified phase.
If a goal is specified, mvn executes only that goal.
```

## Build Features

### GroupId, ArtifactId, & Version

Maven introduces GroupId, ArtifactId and version for better artifact management.

### Directory Layout

Prescribes a Standard Directory Layout

### Dependency Management

Supports declarative Dependency Management. Lets maven analyse the dependencies and helps in choosing the right version and help resolve conflicts.

### Repository Management

In conjunction with versioning, repository management allows download, storing, handling and packaging of artifacts in a seamless way.

Repository management

### Profiles

Allows a single project to be build in multiple ways

Profiles to support build variations/flavors

### Other Features

```
Custom behavour with plugins
Archtetype
```
## POM File

Pom file structure

A single XML file at the project and module level which defines a blueprint for mvn execution.

It contains details of

```
Parent POM
Child modules
```

```
Artifact versioning
Dependencies
Repository to use
Properties
Plugins
Profiles
```
and more.

POM files can have hierarchical structure. A super POM can be defined to capture common artifact verisons, plugin configurations, dependencies etc.
